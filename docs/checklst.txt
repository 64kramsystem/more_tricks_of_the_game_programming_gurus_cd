================================================================
 
This is a standard set of points for Epic beta-testers to look into when
testing a new game.  It covers everything from compatibility to gameplay and
marketing.  Please go through the list and answer everything that applies to
you (with your hardware and software).
 
Then, post your response in the Epic beta-test forum.  If the large amount
of questions is intimidating,  you can answer and post one section at a
time.  Thanks.
